# Background

The team believes in the future of modular blockchain.
Instead of gathering everything in one chain, all apps and chains will distribute the functions they can do well to each other and do it where they can.

Builders who want short finality and high TPS can use Klaytn. Developers who wish to guarantee code safety will use Move to deploy on Sui and Aptos. And if you want to leverage shared security and IBC, you might deploy your own chain with the Cosmos SDK.

The choice is up for each application. The space will continue to expand as more and more apps/chains launch.

However, **data(assets, actions, and information) should move seamlessly and freely between them.** For instance, we cannot use one's wallet address to represent a "user." Users will spread their activity through multiple wallet addresses in various chains. We will gather information on the blockchain into one in the long run, starting with collecting these wallets and using them to define the true user identity.
